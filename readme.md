Build instructions

I recommend using [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/#section=windows) for this project, but VSCode & other IDEs work just as well!

**Step 1:**

- Use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) & clone the repository wherever you'd like (Clone URL: `https://github.com/izzydesigns/Yarnball-Demo.git`) **OR**
- Download the repository via the "Download ZIP" button & decompress the project files wherever you'd like.

**Step 2:**

- Open your desired IDE and open the project folder as a new project

**Step 3:**

- Run `npm install` to install the node dependencies within the project
- Then you can run `npm start` to serve the `index.html` file locally! (useful for testing on various devices)
- After running `npm start`, visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in your preferred browser to play!
